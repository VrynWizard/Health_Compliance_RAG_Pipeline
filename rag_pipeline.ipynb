      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The question about \"OMB delineations\" pertains to the updates and changes in the definition of Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) and other geographical classifications used for determining wage indices in healthcare settings. These delineations are crucial for adjusting payment rates, as they reflect geographical variations in labor markets. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) periodically updates these delineations to ensure they align with current population data and economic conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the final rule for FY 2025 regarding the Hospice Wage Index and Rate Update, OMB Bulletin No. 23-01 issued on July 21, 2023, establishes revised delineations for Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), Micropolitan Statistical Areas, Combined Statistical Areas (CSAs), and Metropolitan Divisions, collectively referred to as CBSAs. These changes are based on the 2020 Standards for Delineating Core-Based Statistical Areas, which were published in the Federal Register (86 FR 37770 through 37778) on July 16, 2021. The bulletin makes significant adjustments, including the creation of new CBSAs, the reclassification of some urban counties to rural, and vice versa, which are crucial for maintaining a payment system that accurately reflects current labor market conditions (Source: hospice_2025_final.json, Page 64208).\n",
      "\n",
      "For the Skilled Nursing Facility Prospective Payment System (SNF PPS) wage index, the implementation of these revised OMB delineations is similarly significant. As outlined in the SNF 2025 Final Rule, the changes will impact how labor market areas are defined. For instance, 54 counties currently considered part of an urban CBSA will be reclassified as rural, while 54 rural counties will transition to urban classification. This redefinition is expected to impact the wage index values, potentially affecting payments to SNFs located in these areas. This transition aims to create a more accurate representation of geographic variation in wage levels and is set to begin in FY 2025 (Source: snf_2025_final.json, Pages 64082-64086).\n",
      "\n",
      "The implementation of these changes requires careful consideration due to potential impacts on payment systems. For example, an urban county becoming rural may see a decrease in its wage index value, affecting SNF payments. The SNF PPS rule includes a 5 percent cap on decreases in a hospital's wage index to mitigate any significant negative impacts. This policy is intended to help providers adjust to the new delineations (Source: snf_2025_final.json, Page 64083).\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the OMB delineations are a vital component of healthcare payment systems, ensuring that wage indices reflect current economic realities. The changes implemented in FY 2025 for both the hospice and SNF PPS wage indices illustrate the dynamic nature of geographical classifications and their significant impact on healthcare economics. By adopting the most recent OMB delineations, these systems aim to maintain accuracy and fairness in compensation, adapting to shifts in population and labor markets.\n",

OMB Bulletin No. 23-01 establishes revised delineations for the MSAs, Micropolitan Statistical Areas, CSAs, and Metropolitan Divisions, collectively referred to as Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs). According to OMB, the delineations reflect the 2020 Standards for Delineating Core Based Statistical Areas (the “2020 Standards”), which appeared in the \\n                        Federal Register\\n                         (86 FR 37770 through 37778) on July 16, 2021, and application of those standards to Census Bureau population and journey-to-work data (for example, 2020 Decennial Census, American Community Survey, and Census Population Estimates Program data). A copy of OMB Bulletin No. 23-01 is available online at: \\n                        https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/OMB-Bulletin-23-01.pdf.\\n\\nThe July 21, 2023, OMB Bulletin No. 23-01 contains a number of significant changes. For example, there are new CBSAs, urban counties that have become rural, rural counties that have become urban, and existing CBSAs that have been split apart. We believe it is important for the hospice wage index to use the latest OMB delineations available in order to maintain the most accurate and up-to-date payment system, reflecting the reality of population shifts and labor market conditions. We further believe that using the most current OMB delineations would increase the integrity of the hospice wage index by creating a more accurate representation of geographic variation in wage levels. We proposed to implement the new OMB delineations as described in the July 21, 2023, OMB Bulletin No. 23-01 for the hospice wage index effective beginning in FY 2025. A summary of comments and our responses on this overall proposal, and on the more specific changes discussed in sections III.A.2.c through III.A.2.f of this final rule that occur as a result of this final policy, are discussed further in this document.',\n",

       "   'document': \"Section: VI. Other SNF PPS Issues > B. Changes to SNF PPS Wage Index > 1. Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) for the FY 2025 SNF PPS Wage Index > a. Background\\n\\nSection 1888(e)(4)(G)(ii) of the Act requires that we adjust the Federal rates to account for differences in area wage levels, using a wage index that the Secretary determines appropriate. Since the inception of the SNF PPS, we have used hospital inpatient wage data in developing a wage index to be applied to SNFs. We proposed to continue this practice for FY 2025, as we continue to believe that in the absence of SNF-specific wage data, using the hospital inpatient wage index data is appropriate and reasonable for the SNF PPS. As explained in the update notice for FY 2005 (69 FR 45786), the SNF PPS does not use the hospital area wage index's occupational mix adjustment, as this adjustment serves specifically to define the occupational categories more clearly in a hospital setting; moreover, the collection of the occupational wage data under the IPPS also excludes any wage data related to SNFs. Therefore, we believe that using the updated wage data exclusive of the occupational mix adjustment continues to be appropriate for SNF payments. As in previous years, we would continue to use, as the basis for the SNF PPS wage index, the IPPS hospital wage data, unadjusted for occupational mix, without taking into account geographic reclassifications under section 1886(d)(8) and (d)(10) of the Act, and without applying the rural floor under section 4410 of the BBA 1997 and the outmigration adjustment under section 1886(d)(13) of the Act. For FY 2025, the updated wage data are for hospital cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2020, and before October 1, 2021 (FY 2021 cost report data).\\n\\nThe applicable SNF PPS wage index value is assigned to a SNF on the basis of the labor market area in which the SNF is geographically located. In the SNF PPS final rule for FY 2006 (70 FR 45026, August 4, 2005), we adopted the changes discussed in OMB Bulletin No. 03-04 (June 6, 2003), which announced revised definitions for Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and the creation of micropolitan statistical areas and combined statistical areas. In adopting the Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSA) geographic designations, we provided for a 1-year transition in FY 2006 with a blended wage index for all providers. For FY 2006, the wage index for each provider consisted of a blend of 50 percent of the FY 2006 MSA-based wage index and 50 percent of the FY 2006 CBSA-based wage index (both using FY 2002 hospital data). We referred to the blended wage index as the FY 2006 SNF PPS transition wage index. As discussed in the SNF PPS final rule for FY 2006 (70 FR 45041), since the expiration of this 1-year transition on September 30, 2006, we have used the full CBSA-based wage index values.\\n\\nIn the FY 2015 SNF PPS final rule (79 FR 45644 through 45646), we finalized changes to the SNF PPS wage index based on the newest OMB delineations, as described in OMB Bulletin No. 13-01, beginning in FY 2015, including a 1-year transition with a blended wage index for FY 2015. OMB Bulletin No. 13-01 established revised delineations for MSAs, Micropolitan Statistical Areas, and Combined Statistical Areas in the United States and Puerto Rico based on the 2010 Census, and provided guidance on the use of the delineations of these statistical areas using standards published in the June 28, 2010 \\n                        Federal Register\\n                         (75 FR 37246 through 37252). Subsequently, on July 15, 2015, OMB issued OMB Bulletin No. 15-01, which provided minor updates to and superseded OMB Bulletin No. 13-01 that was issued on February 28, 2013. The attachment to OMB Bulletin No. 15-01 provided detailed information on the update to statistical areas since February 28, 2013. The updates provided in OMB Bulletin No. 15-01 were based on the application of the 2010 Standards for Delineating Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas to Census Bureau population estimates for July 1, 2012 and July 1, 2013. In addition, on August 15, 2017, OMB issued Bulletin No. 17-01 which announced a new urban CBSA, Twin Falls, Idaho (CBSA 46300). As we previously stated in the FY 2008 SNF PPS proposed and final rules (72 FR 25538 through 25539, and 72 FR 43423), and as we noted in the proposed rule, this and all subsequent SNF PPS rules and notices are considered to incorporate any updates and revisions set forth in the most recent OMB bulletin that applies to the hospital wage data used to determine the current SNF PPS wage index.\\n\\nOn April 10, 2018, OMB issued OMB Bulletin No. 18-03 which superseded the August 15, 2017 OMB Bulletin No. 17-01. Subsequently, on September 14, 2018, OMB issued OMB Bulletin No. 18-04, which superseded the April 10, 2018 OMB Bulletin No. 18-03. These bulletins established revised delineations for MSAs, Micropolitan Statistical Areas, and Combined Statistical Areas, and provided guidance on the use of the delineations of these statistical areas. A copy of OMB Bulletin No. 18-04, may be obtained at \\n                        https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Bulletin-18-04.pdf.\\n                          \\n                        \\n                        While OMB Bulletin No. 18-04 is not based on new census data, it includes some material changes to the OMB statistical area delineations, including some new CBSAs, urban counties that would become rural, rural counties that would become urban, and existing CBSAs that would be split apart. OMB issued further revised CBSA delineations in OMB Bulletin No. 20-01, on March 6, 2020 (available on the web at \\n                        https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bulletin-20-01.pdf\\n                        ). However, we determined that the changes in OMB Bulletin No. 20-01 do not impact the CBSA-based labor market area delineations adopted in FY 2021. Therefore, CMS did not propose to adopt the revised OMB delineations identified in OMB Bulletin No. 20-01 for FY 2022 through FY 2024.\\n\\nOn July 21, 2023, OMB issued OMB Bulletin No. 23-01 (available at \\n                        https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/OMB-Bulletin-23-01.pdf\\n                        ) which updates and supersedes OMB Bulletin No. 20-01 based upon the 2020 Standards for Delineating Core Based Statistical Areas (“the 2020 Standards”) published by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on July 16, 2021 (86 FR 37770). OMB Bulletin No. 23-01 revised CBSA delineations which are comprised of counties and equivalent entities (for example, boroughs, a city and borough, and a municipality in Alaska, planning regions in Connecticut, parishes in Louisiana, municipios in Puerto Rico, and independent cities in Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia). For FY 2025, we are adopting the revised OMB delineations identified in OMB Bulletin No. 23-01.\\n\\nTo implement these changes for the SNF PPS beginning in FY 2025, it is necessary to identify the revised labor market area delineation for each affected county and provider in the country. The revisions OMB published on July 21, 2023 contain a number of significant changes. For example, under the revised OMB delineations, there would be new CBSAs, urban counties that would become rural, rural counties that would become urban, and existing CBSAs that would split apart. We discussed these changes in more detail in the proposed rule.\",\n",

In other cases, when we adopt the new OMB delineations, counties will shift between existing and new CBSAs, changing the constituent makeup of the CBSAs.\\n\\nIn one type of change, an entire CBSA will be subsumed by another CBSA. For example, CBSA 31460 (Madera, CA) currently is a single county (Madera, CA) CBSA. Madera County will be a part of CBSA 23420 (Fresno, CA) under the new OMB delineations.\\n\\nIn another type of change, some CBSAs have counties that would split off to become part of, or to form, entirely new labor market areas. For example, CBSA 29404 (Lake County-Kenosha County, IL-WI) currently is comprised of two counties (Lake County, IL, and Kenosha County, WI). Under the new OMB delineations, Kenosha county will split off and form the new CBSA 28450 (Kenosha, WI), while Lake county would remain in CBSA 29404.\\n\\nFinally, in some cases, a CBSA will lose counties to another existing CBSA when we adopt the new OMB delineations. For example, Meade County, KY, will move from CBSA 21060 (Elizabethtown-Fort Knox, KY) to CBSA 31140 (Louisville/Jefferson County, KY-IN). CBSA 21060 will still exist in the new labor market delineations with fewer constituent counties. Table 24 lists the urban counties that will move from one urban CBSA to another urban CBSA under the new OMB delineations.\\n\\nIf providers located in these counties move from one CBSA to another under the new OMB delineations, there may be impacts, both negative and positive, upon their specific wage index values.\\n\\nIn other cases, adopting the revised OMB delineations will involve a change only in CBSA name and/or number, while the CBSA continues to encompass the same constituent counties. For example, CBSA 19430 (Dayton-Kettering, OH) will experience a change to its name and become CBSA 19430 (Dayton-Kettering-Beavercreek, OH), while all of its three constituent counties will remain the same. We consider these changes (where only the CBSA name and/or number will change) to be inconsequential changes with respect to the SNF PPS wage index.

The remaining counties that currently make up 47894 (Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV) would move into CBSA 11694 (Arlington-Alexandria-Reston, VA-WV). Finally, in some cases, a CBSA will lose counties to another existing \\n                        \\n                        CBSA if we adopt the new OMB delineations. For example, Grainger County, TN would move from CBSA 34100 (Morristown, TN) into CBSA 28940 (Knoxville, TN). Table 7 lists the 73 urban counties that would move from one urban CBSA to a new or modified urban CBSA if we adopt the revised OMB delineations.',\n",

       "   'document': \"Section: III. Provisions of the Final Rule > A. Final FY 2025 Hospice Wage Index and Rate Update > 2. Implementation of New Labor Market Delineations > a. Micropolitan Statistical Areas\\n\\nAs discussed in the FY 2006 Hospice Wage Index and Payment Rate Update proposed rule (70 FR 22397) and final rule (70 FR 45132), we considered how to use the Micropolitan Statistical Area definitions in the calculation of the wage index. Previously, OMB defined a “Micropolitan Statistical Area” as a “CBSA” “associated with at least one urban cluster that has a population of at least 10,000, but less than 50,000” (75 FR 37252). We refer to these as Micropolitan Areas. After extensive impact analysis, consistent with the treatment of these areas under the IPPS as discussed in the FY 2005 IPPS final rule (69 FR 49029), we determined the best course of action would be to treat Micropolitan Areas as “rural” and include them in the calculation of each State's Hospice rural wage index (70 FR 22397 and 70 FR 45132). Thus, the hospice statewide rural wage index has been determined using IPPS hospital data from hospitals located in non-MSAs. In the FY 2021 Hospice final rule (85 FR 47074, 47080), we finalized a policy to continue to treat Micropolitan Areas as “rural” and to include Micropolitan Areas in the calculation of each State's rural wage index.\\n\\nThe OMB “2020 Standards” continues to define a “Micropolitan Statistical Area” as a CBSA with at least one Urban Area that has a population of at least 10,000, but less than 50,000. The Micropolitan Statistical Area comprises the central county or counties containing the core, plus adjacent outlying counties having a high degree of social and economic integration with the central county, or counties as measured through commuting. (86 FR 37778). Overall, there are the same number of Micropolitan Areas (542) under the new OMB delineations based on the 2020 Census as there were using the 2010 Census. We note, however, that a number of urban counties have switched status and have joined or become Micropolitan Areas, and some counties that once were part of a Micropolitan Area, and thus were treated as rural, have become urban based on the 2020 Decennial Census data. We believe that the best course of action would be to continue our established policy and include Micropolitan Areas in each State's rural wage index as these areas continue to be defined as having relatively small urban cores (populations of 10,000 to 49,999). Therefore, in conjunction with our proposal to implement the new OMB labor market delineations beginning in FY 2025, and consistent with the treatment of Micropolitan Areas under \\n                        \\n                        the IPPS, we also proposed to continue to treat Micropolitan Areas as “rural” and to include Micropolitan Areas in the calculation of each State's rural wage index.\\n\\nFinal Decision: Final Decision:\\n                         We did not receive any comments on our proposal to continue to treat Micropolitan Areas as rural and to include those areas in the calculation of each State's rural wage index. We are finalizing this policy as proposed.\",\n",

Implementation of Revised Labor Market Area Delineations\\n\\nWe typically delay implementing OMB labor market area delineations to allow for sufficient time to assess the new changes. For example, as discussed in the FY 2014 SNF PPS proposed rule (78 FR 26448) and final rule (78 FR 47952), we delayed implementing the revised OMB statistical area delineations described in OMB Bulletin No. 13-01 to allow for sufficient time to assess the new changes. We believe it is important for the SNF PPS to use the latest labor market area delineations available as soon as is reasonably possible to maintain a more accurate and up-to-date payment system that reflects the reality of population shifts and labor market conditions. We further believe that using the delineations reflected in OMB Bulletin No. 23-01 would increase the integrity of the SNF PPS wage index system by creating a more accurate representation of geographic variations in wage levels. We have reviewed our findings and impacts relating to the revised OMB delineations set forth in OMB Bulletin No. 23-01 and find no compelling reason to further delay implementation. Because we believe we have broad authority under section 1888(e)(4)(G)(ii) of the Act to determine the labor market areas used for the SNF PPS wage index, and because we believe the delineations reflected in OMB Bulletin No. 23-01 better reflect the local economies and wage levels of the areas in which hospitals are currently located, we proposed to implement the revised OMB delineations as described in the July 21, 2023 OMB Bulletin No. 23-01, for the SNF PPS wage index effective beginning in FY 2025. In addition, we will apply the permanent 5 percent cap policy in FY 2025 on decreases in a hospital's wage index compared to its wage index for the prior fiscal year (FY 2024) to assist providers in adapting to the revised OMB delineations (if we finalize the implementation of such delineations for the SNF PPS wage index beginning in FY 2025). This policy is discussed in more detail in the proposed rule. We solicited comments on these proposals.\\n\\nWe received public comments on these proposals. The following is a summary of the comments we received and our responses.\\n\\nComments and Responses:\\nComment 1: Comment:\\n                         Commenters generally support the proposed policies for FY 2025. One commenter stated that it “seems to strike a balance between fairly compensating SNFs, promoting quality care, and enhancing regulatory oversight.” Another commenter appreciates that CMS is not requiring the commitment resources needed to do cost report audits at this time. However, a number of these commenters also recommend CMS continue to reform the wage index policies. These recommendations included suggestions such as modifying the current methodology by developing a reclassification policy similar to the hospital wage index reclassification policy or developing a SNF-specific wage index.\\nResponse 1: Response:\\n                         We appreciate the commenters' support of the wage index proposed policies for FY 2025. In the absence of a SNF-specific wage index, we continue to believe the use of the pre-reclassified and pre-floor hospital wage data (without the occupational mix adjustment) continue to be an appropriate and reasonable proxy for the SNF PPS. For a detailed discussion of the rationale for our current wage index policies and for responses to these recurring comments, we refer readers to the FY 2024 SNF PPS final rule (88 FR 53211 through 53215) and the FY 2016 SNF PPS final rule (80 FR 46401 through 46402).\\n\\nComment 2: Comment:\\n                         One commenter, who disagrees with the proposed delineation changes, specifically expressed concerns with the wage index decrease of both Rock County, Minnesota, and McHenry County, North Dakota. Both counties will transition from rural to urban designation and in turn will experience slightly over a 12 percent decrease from FY 2024 to FY 2025. Due to the decline in wage index, the commenter strongly requests CMS to review the wage index data for Trinity Health (the only rural PPS hospital in North Dakota prior to the proposed designation change).\\nResponse 2: Response:\\n                         We understand that some CBSAs may experience a wage index decline compared to the previous fiscal year. For North Dakota, our investigation discovered the wage data for Trinity Health (provider 350006) was audited in FY 2025 with no issues reported. The average hourly wage reported for Trinity Health declined 7 percent since FY 2024. For the purposes of the SNF PPS, if a SNF (not hospital) experience a rural or urban redesignation due to the proposed delineation changes for FY 2025 and their wage index resulted in decline since FY 2024, the 5 percent cap policy will be applied. Therefore, we continue to believe that the 5 percent cap policy will mitigate any significant decreases a SNF may experience due to the revised OMB delineations. Additional details on the wage index transition policy for FY 2025 is discussed further below in this section. After consideration of public comments, we are finalizing our proposal regarding the implementation of the revised labor market area delineations for FY 2025.\\n\\n\",\n",

      "The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) delineations play a crucial role in hospice regulations, primarily influencing the hospice wage index, which is a fundamental component of the Medicare hospice payment system. The hospice wage index is utilized to adjust payments according to geographic differences in wage levels across the United States. This ensures that payments are equitable and reflect the local labor market conditions. According to the Hospice 2025 Final Rule, Section III.A.2, the most recent OMB delineations, as outlined in OMB Bulletin No. 23-01, were issued on July 21, 2023. These updates supersede the previous delineations from OMB Bulletin No. 20-01, which was released on March 6, 2020 (hospice_2025_final.json, page 64208).\n",
      "\n",
      "The OMB delineations include updates to Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), Micropolitan Statistical Areas, Combined Statistical Areas (CSAs), and Metropolitan Divisions, collectively referred to as Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs). The updates are based on the 2020 Standards for Delineating Core Based Statistical Areas and reflect data from the 2020 Decennial Census, among other sources. The adoption of these new delineations is aimed at maintaining an accurate and up-to-date payment system that mirrors population shifts and labor market conditions. The integrity of the hospice wage index is enhanced by using the most current OMB delineations, as they provide a more accurate representation of geographic wage variations (hospice_2025_final.json, page 64208).\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the Final Rule for FY 2025 outlines the implementation of these updated delineations, emphasizing the importance of aligning the hospice wage index with the latest OMB updates to ensure budget neutrality across all four levels of hospice care. This approach ensures that updates in wage data do not adversely affect overall spending within the hospice program. The implementation of new OMB delineations is a continuation of the historical practice of adopting the latest updates in subsequent rulemaking processes, reflecting the dynamic nature of geographic and demographic changes (hospice_2025_final.json, Section I. Executive Summary, page 64202).\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the OMB delineations are critical to determining the hospice wage index, which adjusts payments based on regional labor costs. The 2025 Final Rule incorporates the latest OMB delineations from Bulletin No. 23-01, ensuring that hospice payments are reflective of current geographic and labor market conditions. This adoption supports the objective of maintaining an equitable and accurate payment system, which is essential for the effective administration of the Medicare hospice benefit.\n",

These updates supersede the previous delineations from OMB Bulletin No. 20-01, which was released on March 6, 2020 (hospice_2025_final.json, page 64208).\\n\\nThe OMB delineations include updates to Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), Micropolitan Statistical Areas, Combined Statistical Areas (CSAs), and Metropolitan Divisions, collectively referred to as Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs). The updates are based on the 2020 Standards for Delineating Core Based Statistical Areas and reflect data from the 2020 Decennial Census, among other sources. The adoption of these new delineations is aimed at maintaining an accurate and up-to-date payment system that mirrors population shifts and labor market conditions. The integrity of the hospice wage index is enhanced by using the most current OMB delineations, as they provide a more accurate representation of geographic wage variations (hospice_2025_final.json, page 64208).\\n\\nFurthermore, the Final Rule for FY 2025 outlines the implementation of these updated delineations, emphasizing the importance of aligning the hospice wage index with the latest OMB updates to ensure budget neutrality across all four levels of hospice care. This approach ensures that updates in wage data do not adversely affect overall spending within the hospice program. The implementation of new OMB delineations is a continuation of the historical practice of adopting the latest updates in subsequent rulemaking processes, reflecting the dynamic nature of geographic and demographic changes (hospice_2025_final.json, Section I. Executive Summary, page 64202).\\n\\nIn summary, the OMB delineations are critical to determining the hospice wage index, which adjusts payments based on regional labor costs. The 2025 Final Rule incorporates the latest OMB delineations from Bulletin No. 23-01, ensuring that hospice payments are reflective of current geographic and labor market conditions. This adoption supports the objective of maintaining an equitable and accurate payment system, which is essential for the effective administration of the Medicare hospice benefit.',\n",

Implementation of New Labor Market Delineations\\n\\nAs discussed, on July 21, 2023, OMB issued Bulletin No. 23-01, which updates and supersedes OMB Bulletin No. 20-01, issued on March 6, 2020. OMB Bulletin No. 23-01 establishes revised delineations for the MSAs, Micropolitan Statistical Areas, CSAs, and Metropolitan Divisions, collectively referred to as Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs). According to OMB, the delineations reflect the 2020 Standards for Delineating Core Based Statistical Areas (the “2020 Standards”), which appeared in the \\n                        Federal Register\\n                         (86 FR 37770 through 37778) on July 16, 2021, and application of those standards to Census Bureau population and journey-to-work data (for example, 2020 Decennial Census, American Community Survey, and Census Population Estimates Program data). A copy of OMB Bulletin No. 23-01 is available online at: \\n                        https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/OMB-Bulletin-23-01.pdf.\\n\\nThe July 21, 2023, OMB Bulletin No. 23-01 contains a number of significant changes. For example, there are new CBSAs, urban counties that have become rural, rural counties that have become urban, and existing CBSAs that have been split apart. We believe it is important for the hospice wage index to use the latest OMB delineations available in order to maintain the most accurate and up-to-date payment system, reflecting the reality of population shifts and labor market conditions. We further believe that using the most current OMB delineations would increase the integrity of the hospice wage index by creating a more accurate representation of geographic variation in wage levels. We proposed to implement the new OMB delineations as described in the July 21, 2023, OMB Bulletin No. 23-01 for the hospice wage index effective beginning in FY 2025. A summary of comments and our responses on this overall proposal, and on the more specific changes discussed in sections III.A.2.c through III.A.2.f of this final rule that occur as a result of this final policy, are discussed further in this document.',\n",

       "   'document': \"Section: II. Background > A. Hospice Care\\n\\nHospice care is a comprehensive, holistic approach to treatment that recognizes the impending death of a terminally ill individual and warrants a change in the focus from curative care to palliative care for relief of pain and for symptom management. Medicare regulations define “palliative care” as patient and family-centered care that optimizes quality of life by anticipating, preventing, and treating suffering. Palliative care throughout the continuum of illness involves addressing physical, intellectual, emotional, social, and spiritual needs and to facilitate patient autonomy, access to information, and choice (42 CFR 418.3). Palliative care is at the core of hospice philosophy and care practices and is a critical component of the Medicare hospice benefit.\\n\\nThe goal of hospice care is to help terminally ill individuals continue life with minimal disruption to normal activities while remaining primarily in the home environment. A hospice uses an interdisciplinary approach to deliver medical, nursing, social, psychological, emotional, and spiritual services through a collaboration of professionals and other caregivers, with the goal of making the beneficiary as physically \\n                        \\n                        and emotionally comfortable as possible. Hospice is compassionate beneficiary and family/caregiver-centered care for those who are terminally ill.\\n\\nAs referenced in our regulations at §\\u2009418.22(b)(1), to be eligible for Medicare hospice services, the patient's attending physician (if any) and the hospice medical director must certify that the individual is “terminally ill,” as defined in section 1861(dd)(3)(A) of the Act and our regulations at §\\u2009418.3; that is, the individual has a medical prognosis that the individual's life expectancy is 6 months or less if the illness runs its normal course. The regulations at §\\u2009418.22(b)(2) require that clinical information and other documentation that support the medical prognosis accompany the certification and be filed in the medical record with it. The regulations at §\\u2009418.22(b)(3) require that the certification and recertification forms, or an addendum to the certification and recertification forms, include a brief narrative explanation of the clinical findings that support a life expectancy of 6 months or less.\\n\\nUnder the Medicare hospice benefit, the election of hospice care is a patient choice and once a terminally ill patient elects to receive hospice care, a hospice interdisciplinary group is essential in the seamless provision of primarily home-based services. The hospice interdisciplinary group works with the beneficiary, family, and caregivers to develop a coordinated, comprehensive care plan; reduce unnecessary diagnostics or ineffective therapies; and maintain ongoing communication with individuals and their families about changes in their condition. The beneficiary's care plan will shift over time to meet the changing needs of the individual, family, and caregiver(s) as the individual approaches the end of life.\\n\\nIf, in the judgment of the hospice interdisciplinary group (as specified at §\\u2009418.56(a)(1)), which includes the hospice physician, the patient's symptoms cannot be effectively managed at home, then the patient is eligible for general inpatient care (GIP), a more medically intense level of care. GIP must be provided in a Medicare-certified hospice freestanding facility, skilled nursing facility, or hospital. GIP is provided to ensure that any new or worsening symptoms are intensively addressed so that the beneficiary can return home for hospice care (routine home care) (RHC). Limited, short-term, intermittent, inpatient respite care (IRC) is also available because of the absence or need for relief of the family or other caregivers. Additionally, an individual can receive continuous home care (CHC) during a period of crisis in which an individual requires continuous care to achieve palliation or management of acute medical symptoms so that the individual can remain at home. CHC may be covered for as much as 24 hours a day, and these periods must be predominantly nursing care, in accordance with the regulations at §\\u2009418.204. A minimum of 8 hours of nursing care or nursing and aide care must be furnished on a particular day to qualify for the CHC rate (§\\u2009418.302(e)(4)).\\n\\nHospices covered by this rule must comply with applicable civil rights laws, including, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, which require covered programs to take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with individuals with disabilities and companions with disabilities, including the provisions of auxiliary aids and services when necessary to afford qualified individuals with disabilities, including applicants, participants, beneficiaries, companions and members of the public, an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a service, program or activity of a recipient or public entity.\\n                        1\\n                        \\n                         Further information may be found at: \\n                        https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html.\\n\\n1\\n                            \\u2009Hospices receiving Medicare Part A funds or other federal financial assistance from the Department are also subject to additional federal civil rights laws, including the Age Discrimination Act, and are subject to conscience and religious freedom laws where applicable.\\n\\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin in federally assisted programs or activities.

Medicare Payment for Hospice Care\\n\\nSections 1812(d), 1813(a)(4), 1814(a)(7), 1814(i), and 1861(dd) of the Act, and the regulations in 42 CFR part 418, establish eligibility requirements, payment standards and procedures; define covered services; and delineate the conditions a hospice must meet to be approved for participation in the Medicare program. Part 418, subpart G, provides for a per diem payment based on one of four prospectively determined rate categories of hospice care (RHC, CHC, IRC, and GIP), based on each day a qualified Medicare beneficiary is under hospice care (once the individual has elected the benefit). This per diem payment is meant to cover all hospice services and items needed to manage the beneficiary's care, as required by section 1861(dd)(1) of the Act.\\n\\nWhile payment made to hospices is to cover all items, services, and drugs for the palliation and management of the terminal illness and related conditions, federal funds cannot be used for prohibited activities, even in the context of a per diem payment. For example, hospices are prohibited from playing a role in medical aid in dying (MAID) where such practices have been legalized in certain States. The Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997 (Pub. L. 105-12, April 30, 1997) prohibits the use of federal funds to provide or pay for any health care item or service or health benefit coverage for the purpose of causing, or assisting to cause, the death of any individual including “mercy killing, euthanasia, or assisted suicide.” However, the prohibition does not pertain to the provision of an item or service for the purpose of alleviating pain or discomfort, even if such use may increase the risk of death, so long as the item or service is not furnished for the specific purpose of causing or accelerating death.\\n\\nThe Medicare hospice benefit has been revised and refined since its implementation after various Acts of Congress and Medicare rules. For a historical list of changes and regulatory actions, we refer readers to the background section of previous Hospice Wage Index and Payment Rate Update rules.\\n                        4\\n\\n4\\n                            \\u2009Hospice Regulations and Notices. \\n                            https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/Hospice/Hospice-Regulations-and-Notices.\",\n",

       "   'document': \"Section: III. Provisions of the Final Rule > B. Clarifying Regulation Text Changes and Technical Edit > 2. Certification of Terminal Illness and Admission to Hospice Care\\n\\nThe Medicare hospice benefit provides coverage for a comprehensive set of services described in section 1861(dd)(1) of the Act for individuals who are deemed “terminally ill” based on a medical prognosis that the individual's life expectancy is 6 months or less, as described in section 1861(dd)(3)(A) of the Act.\\n\\nAs such, section 1814(a)(7)(A) of the Act requires the individual's attending physician (if the patient designates an attending physician) and hospice medical director or physician member of the IDG to certify in writing at the beginning of the first 90-day period of hospice care that the individual is “terminally ill” based on the physician's or medical director's clinical judgment regarding the normal course of the individual's illness. In a subsequent 90- or 60-day period of hospice care, only the hospice medical director or the physician member of the IDG is required to recertify at the beginning of the period that the patient is terminally ill based on such clinical judgment.\\n\\nThe CoPs at §\\u2009418.102 state that “when the medical director is not available, a physician designated by the hospice assumes the same responsibilities and obligations as the medical director.” The term “physician designee” was utilized in the 1983 hospice final rule (48 FR 56029) that implemented the Medicare hospice benefit when describing who can establish and review the hospice plan of care and was later defined and finalized in the FY 2008 hospice final rule (73 FR 32093) in response to comments requesting CMS clarify this individual's role. Section 418.3 defines “physician designee” to mean a doctor of medicine or osteopathy designated by the hospice who assumes the same responsibilities and obligations as the medical director when the medical director is not available. Currently, the requirements at §\\u2009418.22(c), Sources of Certification, state that for the initial 90-day period, the hospice must obtain written certification statements from the medical director of the hospice or the physician member of the IDG and the individual's attending physician if the individual has an attending physician. For subsequent periods, only the “medical director of the hospice or the physician member of the interdisciplinary group” must certify terminal illness. Similarly, the requirements at §\\u2009418.22(b), Content of Certification, only include the “the physician's or medical director's” when referencing the clinical judgment on which the certification must be based. Additionally, §\\u2009418.25, Admission to Hospice Care, only refers to the recommendation of the hospice medical director (in consultation with the patient's attending physician (if any)) when determining admission to hospice and when reaching a decision to certify that the patient is terminally ill. We note that in the preamble of the proposed rule, we inadvertently referred to paragraph (b) of §\\u2009418.22 as the paragraph we proposed to amend. However, the proposed amendment to the text of the regulation was to paragraph (c) of §\\u2009418.22. We refer in the preamble to this final rule to the correct paragraph of §\\u2009418.22, which is paragraph (c), not paragraph (b).\\n\\nIn order to align §§\\u2009418.22(c) and 418.25 with the CoPs at §\\u2009418.102, we proposed to add “physician designee (as defined in §\\u2009418.3)” to clarify that when the medical director is not available, a physician designated by the hospice, who is assuming the same responsibilities and obligations as the medical director, may certify terminal illness and determine admission to hospice care. We clarified that this does not connote a change in policy; rather, we believe aligning the language at §§\\u2009418.22(c) and 418.25 with the CoPs at §\\u2009418.102 allows for greater clarity and consistency between key components of hospice regulations and policies.\\n\\nWe received 29 comments on these proposed clarifying hospice regulation text changes. A summary of the comments and our responses to those comments are as follows:\\n\\nComments and Responses:\\nComment 1: Comment:\\n                         All commenters supported the clarifying regulation text changes and applauded CMS for the clarification and consistency between key components of the hospice regulations. Commenters stated that the clarification will help simplify language, reduce confusion among stakeholders (that is, hospice providers, CMS audit contractors, and Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs)), and protect hospices against inappropriate citations.\\nResponse 1: Response:\\n                         We thank commenters for their support.\\n\\nComment 2: Comment:\\n                         Several commenters requested “physician member of the interdisciplinary group” be added to §\\u2009418.25 to further reduce confusion and provide clarity regarding the hospice admission process. Additionally, one commenter requested that nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) be allowed to certify a beneficiary as terminally ill and be included on initial hospice certifications.\\nResponse 2: Response:\\n                         We thank commenters for their recommendations; however, adding “physician member of the interdisciplinary group” to §\\u2009418.25 would be a substantive policy change and the proposals included in the proposed rule were intended only to clarify existing policy. Additionally, allowing NPs and PAs to certify a beneficiary as terminally ill is not permitted under the statute.\\n\\n\\n\\nFinal Decision: Final Decision:\\n                         We are finalizing the regulation text revisions to add “physician designee (as defined in §\\u2009418.3)” at §§\\u2009418.22(c) and 418.25 as proposed.\",\n",
